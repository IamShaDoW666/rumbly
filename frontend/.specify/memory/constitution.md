# Assembly Runner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technology Stack
The project will be a Vite-powered React application, written in TypeScript. Styling will be implemented using Tailwind CSS, and UI components will be sourced exclusively from shadcn/ui.

### II. Code Quality
Code must be simple, well-organized, and easy to understand. Follow standard React best practices.

### III. User Interface
The user interface should be clean, intuitive, and focused on the primary task of running assembly code.

### IV. Testing
Tests should not be written unless explicitly asked for. When tests are requested, they should be written using Vitest and React Testing Library.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project-level decisions. All development activities must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project owner.
