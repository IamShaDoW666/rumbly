# Implementation Plan: Code Editor Interface

**Branch**: `003-create-a-interface` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-create-a-interface/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a web-based interface for writing and executing NASM assembly code. The interface will feature a code editor with syntax highlighting and line numbers, and a button to send the code to an API for execution. The implementation will adhere to the project's constitution, using React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library (Not requested for this feature)
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: Maximum of 500 lines of code

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Technology Stack**: Does the proposed solution use Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui? - **PASS**
- **Code Quality**: Is the code simple, well-organized, and does it follow React best practices? - **PASS**
- **User Interface**: Is the UI clean, intuitive, and focused on the core functionality? - **PASS**
- **Testing**: Are tests being written only if explicitly requested? - **PASS**

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)
```
specs/003-create-a-interface/
├── plan.md              # This file (/plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks command - NOT created by /plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── CodeEditor.tsx
└── App.tsx
```

**Structure Decision**: The project is a single-page application, so the source code will be organized within the `src` directory. A new `CodeEditor` component will be created to encapsulate the editor's functionality.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
All technical decisions are based on the project's constitution and the clarifications provided. No further research is required.

**Output**: `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Data Model**: The only data is the assembly code (a string). A simple `data-model.md` will be created.
2.  **API Contracts**: This is a frontend-only feature for now. An empty `contracts` directory will be created.
3.  **Quickstart**: A `quickstart.md` file will be created with instructions on how to run the feature.
4.  **Agent File**: The `GEMINI.md` file will be updated with the new component information.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, `GEMINI.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create a new `CodeEditor.tsx` component.
- Implement the text area with syntax highlighting and line numbers.
- Implement the "Send to API" button.
- Add logic to disable the button when the editor is empty.
- Add logic to send the code to the API and display the response.
- Integrate the `CodeEditor` component into the main `App.tsx` file.

**Ordering Strategy**:
1.  Create the `CodeEditor.tsx` component.
2.  Implement the UI of the component.
3.  Implement the functionality of the component.
4.  Integrate the component into the `App.tsx` file.

**Estimated Output**: 5-7 tasks in `tasks.md`

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
