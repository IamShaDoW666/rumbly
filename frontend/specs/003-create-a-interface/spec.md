# Feature Specification: Code Editor Interface

**Feature Branch**: `003-create-a-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a interface with basic code editing textarea. I want users to be able to write there assembly (NASM) code and then send it to an API endpoint using a button. The interface must be friendly and easy to use. Make sure to also consider mobile devices."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What should happen after the code is sent to the API? → A: Show the raw API response.
- Q: How should API errors be handled? → A: Show a generic error message.
- Q: Should there be any syntax highlighting for the NASM assembly code in the text area? → A: Yes
- Q: What is the expected maximum size of the assembly code to be submitted? → A: Maximum of 500 lines
- Q: Should the text area have line numbers? → A: Yes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to write NASM assembly code in a text area and click a button to send it to an API endpoint for processing, so that I can easily execute my code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has opened the interface, **When** they type NASM assembly code into the text area, **Then** the code should be visible and editable.
2. **Given** the user has entered code into the text area, **When** they click the "Send to API" button, **Then** the code should be sent to the specified API endpoint.
3. **Given** the interface is viewed on a mobile device, **When** the user interacts with the text area and button, **Then** the interface should be responsive and easy to use.
4. **Given** the code editor is empty, **When** the user views the "Send to API" button, **Then** the button should be disabled.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user tries to send empty code to the API? → The "Send to API" button will be disabled.
- How does the system handle API connection errors? → Show a generic error message.
- What happens if the user inputs code that is not valid NASM assembly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a text area for users to write and edit NASM assembly code.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a button to trigger sending the a code to an API endpoint.
- **FR-003**: The interface MUST be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST send the content of the text area to a pre-defined API endpoint when the button is clicked.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display the raw API response after the code is sent to the API.
- **FR-007**: The "Send to API" button MUST be disabled if the code editor is empty.
- **FR-008**: The text area MUST support syntax highlighting for NASM assembly code.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle assembly code submissions up to a maximum of 500 lines.
- **FR-010**: The text area MUST have line numbers.
